## BUILDING

### Prerequisites
The build requires the following tools:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)
- [Recommended: git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

First download and install Visual Studio and CMake like any other GUI application.<br>
Install git via the Installer from the website or directly in Powershell:
- `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

Then install vcpkg via git as described in the Microsoft documentation:
- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`
- Run the bootstrap script `cd vcpkg && .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

Install SDL2 via vcpkg: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2`, for x86: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2:x86-windows`

### Generating the project file
Create a thug2-sdl/build directory. Then build the VS Solution with CMake from that directory via Powershell:
```
cmake .. -A win32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/[vcpkg directory]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
Set the optimization for the partymod dll to O0 (disable optimization) because MSVC seems to break certain functions when optimization is enabled.
<br><br>
The `.sln` file is in the `build` directory. Make sure to select win32 and Release as the project's build options in Visual Studio. Build the actual DLL with `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
