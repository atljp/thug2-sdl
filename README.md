## MOD LOADER

In partymod.ini, you can activate and define legacy script mods in the `AdditionalMods` section like this:
```
[AdditionalMods]
UseMod=1
Folder=data/pre/mymod
```
You place mod contents inside your mod folder at `C:\<thug2-install-path>\Game\Data\pre\mymod`<br>
The folder needs a `mod.ini` so the contents can be loaded properly. It can look like this:
```
[MODINFO]
Name=MyMod
qb_scripts.prx=modded_scripts.prx
anims.prx=modded_anims.prx
```
The file names on the left are the original names of THUG2 scripts you're replacing. The modded files on the right have to be inside the mod folder alongside the mod.ini file.<br>
File endings are needed here.<br><br>
When activated, the game will perform various checks when launching the game to make sure that the folder and files exist as specified. If everything was loaded correctly, the window title will also contain the loaded mod name.

## BUILDING

### Prerequisites
The build requires the following tools:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)
- [Recommended: git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

First download and install Visual Studio and CMake like any other GUI application.<br>
Install git via the Installer from the website or directly in Powershell:
- `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

Then install vcpkg via git as described in the Microsoft documentation:
- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`
- Run the bootstrap script `cd vcpkg && .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

Install SDL2 via vcpkg: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2`, for x86: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2:x86-windows`

### Generating the project file
Create a thug2-sdl/build directory. Then build the VS Solution with CMake from that directory via Powershell:
```
cmake .. -A win32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/[vcpkg directory]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
Set the optimization for the partymod dll to O0 (disable optimization) because MSVC seems to break certain functions when optimization is enabled.
<br><br>
The `.sln` file is in the `build` directory. Make sure to select win32 and Release as the project's build options in Visual Studio. Build the actual DLL with `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
